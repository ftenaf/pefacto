HistInfo_AppEnd = Emergence of the application closing window, with colours \
                  degraded in green. The database closes securely and saves \
                  all the information.

HistInfo_AppStart = Emergence of the main window of the application. It \
                    consists of a tree, located on the upper left hand side, \
                    in which a specific type of invoice may be selected; the \
                    corresponding list is then displayed in the main table. A \
                    menu is associated to each type of invoice (in the lower \
                    central part) with specific actions for each type of \
                    invoice; on the left hand side of the window there is a \
                    series of buttons with the general functions which the \
                    application can carry out. Finally, at the top of the \
                    window there is a search filter to facilitate the process \
                    of listing the invoices stored in the application.

HistInfo_ConfChange = Modifying the user configurable application parameters \
                      such as the language or the logo.

HistInfo_EditIn = Editing all the data associated with a specific invoice (or \
                  a specific draft) with the possibility of modifying the \
                  data. A draft may be saved or the invoice may be signed once \
                  they have been edited.

HistInfo_ExpBBDD = Exporting from the application's database (with all the \
                   invoices and drafts stored in it) to a file (with a .fedb \
                   extension) in order to import from another electronic \
                   billing application.</P>

HistInfo_GenIVA = Generating a summary of all invoices (issued, received, or \
                  both) in which the item (or one of the items) presents VAT \
                  as an output tax. The equivalence surcharge (ES) associated \
                  with each item (if it exists) is also shown, in addition to \
                  a final summary of the total tax base, the total taxes (in \
                  relation to VAT and ES) and the total amount.

HistInfo_ImpBBDD = Importing from an external database (with .fedb extension) \
                   into the application. After importing, all the invoices and \
                   drafts in the database will be accessible from the \
                   application.

HistInfo_NewParty = Creating a totally new subject (issuer or recipient) or \
                    modifying an existing one (in this case, the application \
                    will show the last subject registered from among all those \
                    that share the same CIF / NIF). In either case, the new \
                    subject created will be assigned a new identifier. It must \
                    also be taken into account that there are a series of \
                    fields which must be filled in (they are marked with an \
                    asterisk: '*') to successfully generate a subject; other \
                    fields are optional. 

HistInfo_ReceiveIn = Receiving an external invoice with an xml or xsig \
                     extension. If this invoice exceeds the three existing \
                     validations (namely: schema, signature and accounting) it \
                     is entered in the application's database and is assigned \
                     the following identifier: "Received-XX", where XX is the \
                     number of invoices received to date.

HistInfo_RectIn = Rectifying an invoice which has been issued or sent. This \
                  action is not associated with drafts or received or \
                  rectifying invoices. Any field of the invoice may be \
                  modified except the invoice number. Subsequently, a draft \
                  may be saved or the rectifying invoice signed (in the second \
                  case, a window will emerge in which the rectified field and \
                  the rectification method must be selected).

HistInfo_ResendIn = Re-sending by e-mail an invoice that has already been sent \
                    where the addressee may be different from the recipient of \
                    the first e-mail

HistInfo_SaveDraft = The details of the draft generated are saved in the \
                     database. Technically, this draft cannot be considered an \
                     invoice as it lacks a digital signature. It is possible \
                     to view this draft to sign it or edit it in order to \
                     modify it and subsequently sign it. In both cases the \
                     draft will disappear from the database and will become an \
                     issued invoice; it will figure as such (with the \
                     appropriate identifier) in the database.

HistInfo_SeeIn = Displaying all the data associated with a specific invoice \
                 (or a specific draft) without the possibility of modifying \
                 the data.

HistInfo_SeeRect = Checking the rectified fields and the associated rectifying \
                   invoice

HistInfo_SendFACe = Sending the invoice generated in XSIG to PeFAC

HistInfo_SendIn = Sending the invoice generated in XSIG format by e-mail

HistInfo_SignIn = A draft is signed with the help of a recognised and valid \
                  digital certificate; In such a case, the draft will \
                  disappear from the database and will become an invoice \
                  issued; it will figure as such (with the appropriate \
                  identifier) in the database. It is not permitted to sign an \
                  invoice which has been issued or sent; a rectifying invoice, \
                  though, may be signed and will figure in the database as an \
                  issued rectifying invoice.
